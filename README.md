Contants the game 'Sorry!' & 'REACH THE GOAL'
allow me to elaborate...

I began project 1 by creating a web site that would enable up to four players to play the game parchessi (ludo, sorry).
This game involves up to four players rolling two dice on thier respective turns to move four pieces the center.

I was able to complete rendering the board and the player pieces as well as the dice that generated a random number on click between 1 and 6.
However I discovered difficulty allowing the player pieces to be moved along their respective paths and toward the goal.
This task halted my progress on the game while I decipered how to complete the task.
Being mindful of my time constraints I decided to create a original game with portions my original project.

here are the rules for REACH THE GOAL:
1- upon opening the game you will be met with a black screen with red start button;
2- when the start button is clicked there will be an alert box that asks you to input the goal you would like to reach this number needs to be a positive integer to validly play the game.
3- after an allowed input is given, the browser will show a screen with two boxes (red and blue) that represent players two outlined boxes that represent the respective players previous rolls and two white boxes represent 6 sided dice.
4- each player takes turns clicking the teal square to roll the dice.
5- each players roll is saved and totaled, the first player to have their total rolls eaquate or surpass the set Goal wins.

some features I included were rendering each players previous rolls in the browser, as well as making it possible to choose the goal you would like to reach(before the number was set to 30);
I also included a feature that allows you to restart the game after a player wins

feature requests:
I recived a comment from a colleague that my game gave an unfair advantage to the player that goes first. One extra feature im working on for the next game is if the players score is greater than the set goal, each following dice roll will be subtracted from the inital goal until the players score exactly equals the set goal.
